ğŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm a frontend developer crafting pixels into seamless user experiences. Lately, I'm diving into the world of Rust ğŸ¦€â€”because who doesnâ€™t love a little systems programming on the side?

ğŸš€ Building UIs by day, tinkering with low-level magic by night.
ğŸ”§ JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and now Rust!
ğŸ“š Always learning, always coding.

"There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses." â€“ Bjarne Stroustrup

Feel free to check out my projects and say hi! ğŸš€
